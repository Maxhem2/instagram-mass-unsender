# Instagram DM Mass Unsender

[ABANDONED] Use https://github.com/thoughtsunificator/instagram-dm-unsender instead!

A JavaScript script to mass unsend direct messages (DMs) from one chat on Instagram.

## How to Use
1. Open your Instagram account in a web browser and go into the chat where you want to unsend all your Messages.
2. Access the developer console in your browser (usually by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + J` or `Cmd + Option + J` or `F12`).
3. Copy the (.js) scripts content (code) and paste it into the developer console.
4. Press `Enter`.

The script will handle all the necessary actions, including waiting for timeouts to work with Instagram rate limits.

## Potential Improvements
Here are some potential improvements for this project that you can consider:

1. **UI Integration**: Create a user interface within Instagram, possibly using browser extensions like Tampermonkey, to make it more user-friendly.

2. **Code Optimization**: Optimize and restructure the code to make the unsending process faster and more efficient.

3. **Video Tutorial**: Consider creating a YouTube tutorial explaining how to use this script and include a link to it in this README for user guidance.

By collaborating on these improvements, we can make this project even more useful and accessible to the community.
